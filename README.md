# Hello I'm Ilker AKBIYIK
## I'm a Paris based web developer who loves drawing and camping
### My Most Recent Repositories Are Mostly About :
* New frameworks I'm trying out
* New libraries I started using
* Games I like playing
* Devops tools I'm trying out

### My Method For Studying and Learning Code :
I like learning by doing. Watching tutorials or going through example projects are useful to see <br>
what's possible. But unless I do and find out why something works the way it works, the information <br>
will not stick.

I think the satisfaction of solving a problem is also a tremendous driving force. 

### What I am Interested In :
Even though most of my projects are about web development, I like exploring data science and machine <br>
learning as well. 

### Currently Working On :
A project I'm building using symfony, react, nginx, docker and mysql. <br>
I'm really inexperienced in symfony but<by the end of the project I'm hoping to be comfortable about the
core topics and increase my basic understanding of symfony
